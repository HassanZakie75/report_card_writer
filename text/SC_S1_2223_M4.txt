3=#E is encouraged to revisit subject and concepts. In addition, #e should make an attempt to read the material and take effective notes in class using strategies like Cornell note-taking/Collaborative note-making/Note-taking/mapping/T-Notes method/5R's of Notes/Sketchnote/Visual Note-taking.
4=#E is also strongly encouraged to consult the teacher and peers on a regular basis in hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of the subject at hand so that #e is able to describe and apply scientific knowledge and understanding to suggest and solve problems set in familiar situations and suggest solutions to problems set in unfamiliar situations.
5=Average
6=#E is able to describe scientific knowledge and understanding to solve problems set in familiar situations and suggest solutions to problems set in unfamiliar situations. #E interprets information to make scientifically supported arguments.
7=#E is expected to continue exploring the concepts and connecting it to global context. In order to achieve this, #e could use various learning strategies such as effective note taking using Cornell method or Mind Mapping so that #e could explain, analyse and evaluate information to make more scientifically supported judgments.
8=Strong
9=#E is able to explain scientific knowledge. #E applies scientific knowledge and understanding to solve problems set in familiar situations and unfamiliar situations. #E could also analyses information to make scientifically supported arguments.He could integrate generate, sort, connect, elaborate to create a concept map so that #e will be consistent in producing an analytical scientific judgement.
10=Well done! Keep up the good work!

17=A more logical, complete, and safe method is needed to improve the quality of the experiment. This can be done by exploring more scientific investigation via Phet or Science buddies website.
18=#E is advised to explain how to manipulate the variable by reading similar scientific investigation.
19=Strong
20=#N explain a problem to be tested by a scientific investigation very well. #E formulate a testable hypothesis using scientific reasoning and also explain in detail how to manipulate the variables. #E is capable to design a logical, complete and safe method in which #e selects the appropriate materials and equipment. Well done! Keep up the good work!

2=#N is able to collect and present data in numerical and/or visual form. In addition, #e could interpret data and explain results Is happy to see that #e attempt to outline the validity of a hypothesis and method based on the outcome of a scientific investigation. Finally, #e is able to outline improvements to the method that would benefit the scientific investigation.
3=#E is advised to improve #h data presentation skills by using the correct graphical representation.
4=#E is encouraged to interpret data and outline results using scientific reasoning that #e learned in the lesson.
5=#E is advised to discuss the validity of a method based on the outcome of a scientific investigation. This can be done by doing self/peer assessment after the experiment.
6=#E is advised to submit the draft to the teacher for constructive feedback.
7=#E is advised to explore the method that would benefit the scientific investigation by trying out different experiments via online simulation, such as Phet or Science buddies website.
8=#E should also focus on #h comprehension of scientific vocabulary and refer to rubrics to achieve the task-specific requirements or expectations.
9=Average
10=#N is able to collect , present and organize data in numerical and/or visual forms . In addition , #e could interpret data and explain results using scientific reason accurately.Not only that #e could evaluate the validity of a hypothesis and method based on the outcome of a scientific investigation, #e is also able to explain the improvements to the method that would benefit the scientific investigation.
11=#E is encouraged to transform the data and interpret the results using scientific reasoning that #e learnt in the lesson.
12=#E is encourage to give constructive suggestion to improve the validity of a method based on the outcome of a scientific investigation. This can be done by doing discussion after the experiment with teacher or peer.
13=#E should also master data interpretation skills like graph drawing and data tabulation. This could be done by exploring more experiments via reference book, Phet online simulation.
14=Strong
