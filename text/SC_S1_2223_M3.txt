16=#E is encouraged to do self-checking using the checklist given in the task sheet before the final submission.
17=A more logical, complete, and safe method is needed to improve the quality of the experiment. This can be done by exploring more scientific investigation via Phet or Science buddies website.
18=Strong
19=#N describes a problem or a question to be tested by a scientific investigation. #E explains a testable hypothesis using scientific reasoning and also describes how to manipulate the variables. #E describes how sufficient, relevant data is collected as well as design a logical, complete and safe method in which #e selects materials and equipment.
20=Well done! Keep up the good work!

1=Weak
2=#N could collect and present the data correctly either in numbers or visual formats. #E analyses the facts and claims the validity of the hypothesis as well as the approach. #E can suggest modifications to the method, but with little reference to scientific research.
3=#E has to work on #h data presentation skills by learning how to organize and present data using correct graphical representations such as bar graphs or line graphs.
4=#E is encouraged to interpret data and outline results using scientific reasoning that #e learned in the lesson.
5=#E is advised to outline the validity of a method based on the outcome of a scientific investigation. This can be done by doing a self/peer assessment after the experiment.
6=#E is advised to submit the draft to the teacher for constructive feedback
7=#E is advised to explore the method that would benefit the scientific investigation
8=#E should also focus on #h comprehension of scientific vocabulary and refer to rubrics to achieve the task-specific requirements or expectations.
9=Average
10=#N could collect, organize and present data in numerical and/or visual forms. #E could interpret data and outline results using scientific reasoning accurately. In addition, #e outlines the validity of a prediction and method based on the outcome of a scientific investigation. Finally, #e is able to outline the validity of the method and suggest improvement based on the outcome of a scientific investigation.
11=#E is encouraged to transform the data and interpret the results using scientific reasoning that #e learned in the lesson.
12=#E is encouraged to give constructive suggestions to improve the validity of a method based on the outcome of a scientific investigation. This can be done by doing a discussion after the experiment with teacher or peer.
13=#E should also master data interpretation skills like graph drawing and data tabulation. This could be done by exploring more experiments via reference book, Phet online simulation.
